# :teddy_bear: Plush-To-The-Rescue
 
This is a 2D simulation game about a stuffed bear running around a prize machine to save other plushies from being picked up by the claw. Plushies are added to the player's line and are dropped off at the chute until the claw inevitably picks up the player. 

*This project was completed for IMD4006 Advanced Game Design & Development, where the constraint was that the game feel had to be "groggy".*
